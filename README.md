# ArrayStack and HistoryStack Example

- This sample project was built live to showcase strategies for implementing and testing a data structure 
iteratively
- we implement an array-based stack in lab7
-draw_example is a Processing project that uses the array-based stack (inherited as a HistoryStack) and implements an undo feature

### Open the Lab7 Project
- importing using Eclipse's `import > existing project` menu

##### To run (but not be able to edit)
  - MacOS, enter a terminal window in the directory containing the .jar file. start the run file with ./run
  - Windows (TODO)

##### To build and run
  - Open the draw_example project by importing using Eclipse's `import > existing project` menu
  - Right click the project folder in eclipse, select run as > run configurations
  - Go to the JRE tab, making sure the ChalkboardTime project is selected in the "Java Application" sub-menu on the left list
  - Select "alternate JRE" and click the installed JREs button.
  - Click the "add" button
  - Select this directory in the finder menu: /Applications/Processing.app/Contents/PlugIns/jdk1.8.0_202.jdk/Contents/Home
